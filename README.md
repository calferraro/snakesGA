# snakesGA
A coppeliaSim simulation that learns the optimal hyperparameters for snake motion by using a Genetic Algorithm

This repository is organized by operating system. Each branch is labelled for its appropriate operating system between Windows, Linux, and MacOS. CoppeliaSim or VREP is a requirement to run the code.

In this branch, we have the main backend Genetic Algorithm which is not operating system specific, the report following development of this work, and this README. Also included here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sef-BdlwiQonOG59uO5Jp16J5sf6oAOx/view?usp=sharing) to the slides for the presentation of the work.

This work was done with Python 3 and CoppeliaSim (formerly VREP), any further details or information can be found in the report [here](https://github.com/calferraro/snakesGA/blob/main/Group%20Project%20Paper.docx.pdf).
